Hi,

I'm a software engineer based in London. I moved there about 5 years ago. Before that I grew up and studied in France, and spent a year in the US.

I currently work at [Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com/london/). I work on backend features supporting the Bloomberg terminal, using mainly C++ and Python. You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nina-martin-20b4648b/).

On my free time I like to run around London's parks and -very slowly- learn how to play the piano.  

I created this site to write about all sorts of things: stuff I read about, stuff I found interesting, places I've been, random thoughts I've had...

If you want to reach out, you can send me an [email](mailto:nina.utc@gmail.com).
